# Louis Thompsons's Tech Test Notes
## `Overview:` 
I have a lot of fun with this task!! I aimed to get it all done within 3 hours. Which I was more or less able to do. I did a little reseach the night before for SVG's and a plan of apporach. But I applied everything within those hours. 

### `Tools Leveraged:` 
**W3W3 Schools **- Transition animations, base styles (buttons, headers).

**Gemini AI** - To quickly generate some simple js code and augemnted my styling (I am more than happy to explain all of the code that I have written)
